## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Systemd Service Configuration

Create systemd service file `/etc/systemd/system/linker-upgrader.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Program Upgrade System
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/opt/linker-upgrader
ExecStart=/opt/linker-upgrader/linker-upgrader -config /etc/linker-upgrader/config.json
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable linker-upgrader
sudo systemctl start linker-upgrader
```

### Docker Deployment

#### Using Pre-built Images

```bash
# Pull the latest version
docker pull ghcr.io/linker-bot/linker-upgrader:latest

# Run container
docker run -d -p 6110:6110 \
  --name linker-upgrader \
  -v /opt/myapp:/opt/myapp \
  -v /etc/linker-upgrader:/etc/linker-upgrader \
  -v ./config.json:/etc/linker-upgrader/config.json \
  ghcr.io/linker-bot/linker-upgrader:latest \
  -config /etc/linker-upgrader/config.json
```

#### Using Docker Compose

```yaml
services:
  linker-upgrader:
    image: ghcr.io/linker-bot/linker-upgrader:latest
    container_name: linker-upgrader
    ports:
      - "6110:6110"
    volumes:
      - /opt/myapp:/opt/myapp
      - ./config.json:/etc/linker-upgrader/config.json
    command: ["-config", "/etc/linker-upgrader/config.json"]
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Nginx Reverse Proxy

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name upgrade.example.com;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        
        # Support large file uploads
        client_max_body_size 200M;
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
        proxy_send_timeout 300s;
    }
}
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **Permission Management**: Recommended to run with minimal privilege principle
- **Network Security**: Use HTTPS and authentication in production environments
- **File Validation**: Verify file integrity and source before upload
- **Backup Strategy**: Regularly clean backup files to avoid disk space shortage
- **Log Monitoring**: Monitor upgrade logs to detect anomalies promptly
